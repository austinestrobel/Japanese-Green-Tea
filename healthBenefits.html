                <p>It is common knowledge around the world that Japanese green tea is healthy, but what exactly about it is so good for you? In ancient Japan, green tea was even used medicinally. Nowadays, green tea still has many health benefits, even if it isnâ€™t being prescribed. It is known for having Vitamin C, caffeine, bioflavonoids, and various minerals such as Manganese, Potassium, and Calcium. However, the two main properties of tea are Catechins (Tannin) and Theanine (Teanin).</p>

                <h3>Catechin</h3>
                <p>Catechins are what give tea its more bitter notes. It has antiviral and antioxidant qualities and is known for reducing bad cholesterol (LDL) and boosting good cholesterol (HDL). Any Catechins that are absorbed into the bloodstream will eventually make it to the liver, promoting your fat metabolism, ultimately resulting in weight loss. As an antiviral, it is both good for preventing and treating common illnesses such as influenza, common colds, coughs, nasal congestion, and sore throats. </p>

                <h3>Theanine</h3>
                <p>Theanine is an amino acid that stimulates alpha brain waves. What this does is give you a feeling of being alert, yet relaxed. This state is great for focusing and pairs quite well with the caffeine content found in green tea by making the stronger effects of caffeine more mellow. Also while in this state, Dopamine levels increase which helps with memory retention. Theanines flavor is sweet, balancing the bitterness of the Catechins.</p>
